# Data Representation Practice Project

## Overview
This website was created as a practice project for representing data retrieve from a [Country REST API](https://restcountries.com/)
The idea for this project was made on another github rep [30 Days of JavaScript](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript)
## Features
- The website will fetch data from the REST API and represent it in two graphs using javascript and CSS
- The bars are generated with CSS; The graph percentage is created with javascript as I created the rules with code
## Running the project
- You only need the files in the src folder and also the index.html on the root directory to run your website based on what you've seen in my github page :)
